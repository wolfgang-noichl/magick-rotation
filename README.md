# Magick Rotation

Magick Rotation is an application that will help Dell, Fujitsu, HP, and Lenovo convertible tablet PC's automatically rotate screen orientation and devices that use the Wacom or evdev drivers.

This is a fork of the [original launchpad project](https://launchpad.net/magick-rotation), which seems to be dead.
To install, just follow the manual install instructions in ./INSTALLER.txt, which are known to work at least for Xubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and 22.04.

Saucy Unity, maybe also later Unity editions also install 'python-appindicator'.

Note: the xinput utility is required. If 'xinput list' entered in a terminal
produces output it is installed.

Magick Rotation is not a Ubuntu specific application. Versions have worked in Arch, Fedora, Gentoo, Mandriva, and openSUSE among others.

Thank you to our testers on Ubuntu forums.
For the Dell XT & XT2's: wildschweini, enneract, Ubuntiac
For the Thinkpads: forti, supr0, linuxd00
For the Fujitsus: dog-soldier, pvdh, Cobuntu

A special thank you to Robert Gerlach for his assistance in adding Fujitsu tablet PC support.
