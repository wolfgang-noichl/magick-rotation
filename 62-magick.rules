# udev rules for tablet pc's using an OEM-WMI or OEM-ACPI

# These rules were compiled for the Ubuntu/Debian GNU/Linux distribution, but others may,

#
# Should you do so, PLEASE CO-ORDINATE ANY CHANGES OR ADDITIONS to 62-magick.rules with
# Jayhawk so that we can try to present users with a standard set of device nodes which
# they can rely on across the board.
